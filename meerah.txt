<p> Meera Chopra was in a relationship with stockbroker Sumit Bhuttan, who was already married to Ruchi Bhuttan and had a five-year-old son. Sumit was planning to divorce his wife so that he could marry Meera. 
On 5 July 2011, Ruchi Bhuttan committed suicide by hanging at her DLF Phase-II residence in Gurgaon. Subsequently, Sumit Bhuttan, Meera Chopra, and Sumit’s family members were booked under several sections of the IPC. However, later, Meera and Sumit’s family members 
were given a clean chit by the police. A Gurgaon session court acquitted Sumit Bhuttan on 16 September 2013. </p>
